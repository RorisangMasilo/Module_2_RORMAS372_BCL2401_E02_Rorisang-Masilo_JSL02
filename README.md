## **[JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM**

### Overview

**Debugging Brief:**
In the current code, users can add the same fitness goal multiple times, leading to duplicate entries in the goal list. To enhance the user experience and prevent duplicates, you need to implement a check to ensure that the same goal cannot be added more than once. If a duplicate goal is detected, it should NOT be added to the list.

**Debugging Task:** Prevent users from adding the same goal more than once

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

To be honest, I cannot say if I have mastered anything, I have only acknowledged that I need to immerse myself religiously in the tech language for my survival, imposter syndrome at a high.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Debugging**: Understanding common DOM manipulation errors, including memory leaks and performance considerations.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Forms and Validation**: I want to better understand the process and importance of validating form data before submission. As well as providing user feedback on validation errors.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in the DOM manipulation of JavaScript. I am glad to have that insight, as it has enlightened me to change my methods of learning and minimise my usage of AI tools for my knowledge and benefit. But also how DOm manipulation is done, especiallly event handling and debugging.
